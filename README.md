# CSSR: Car Simulation Software by ROS
**March 4, 2025 (Version 1.2.2)**
## Introduction
CSSR provides a simulation platform for testing the decision-making and planning system of autonomous vehicles.

## Software Architecture
The code is organized as follows:
- `src/CSSR` is the package used to run the simulation.
- `src/CSSR/scripts/main.pyc` is used to receive and send ROS messages.
- `src/CSSR/scripts/GUI.pyc` is used to run the interface and show the simulation figure.
- `src/CSSR/scripts/test.pyc` is used to run the test program to provide control messages to CSSR.
- `src/CSSR/launch/cssr.launch` is used to launch CSSR.
- `src/CSSR/launch/config.json` defines the initial vehicle state and obstacles.
- `src/cav_msgs` is the package that contains the messages used in the simulation.
- `src/cav_msgs/msg/Control.msg` defines the control message used in ROS communication.
- `src/cav_msgs/msg/Obstacle.msg` defines one obstacle in the field.
- `src/cav_msgs/msg/ObstacleVec.msg` defines the obstacle vector that combines all obstacle information in the field.
- `src/cav_msgs/msg/VehicleState.msg` defines the vehicle state used in ROS communication.

## Software Interfaces
The ROS message **subscribed** by CSSR is listed below:
- `/Control` is a `Control` message. CSSR uses this message to control the vehicle state in the simulation.  

The ROS messages **published** by CSSR are listed below:
- `/Obstacle` is an `ObstacleVec` message and combines all obstacle information in the field.
- `/VehicleState` is a `VehicleState` message and contains the state of the vehicle in the simulation.

The detailed definitions of the messages above can be found in the `src/cav_msgs/msg` folder.

**Therefore, the user needs to develop a program that can subscribe to the `/Obstacle` and `/VehicleState` messages published by CSSR, and publish `/Control` messages to control the car in the simulation.**

## Environment Setup
You can unzip the provided `CSSR.zip`, or download the code from the GitHub link below: 
<br>[https://github.com/myTristan/CSSR.git](https://github.com/myTristan/CSSR.git)<br>
Then you can install **python 3.8** and create a virtual python environment, and substitute `env` with your preferred environment name if you like.
```
cd CSSR
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
Then you can install CSSR dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 If you encounter issues downloading PyQt5, you can run the following command:
```
pip install PyQt5 -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/   
```
Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open a new command window, and build the ROS workspace:
```
cd CSSR
catkin_make
```

## Run CSSR
Open a new command window in the `CSSR/src/CSSR/scripts` folder, and run the code below:
```
chmod +x *.pyc
``` 
The step above is only required **the first time** you run CSSR.  
Open another new command window in the `CSSR` folder, and run the code below:
```
source env/bin/activate
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch cssr cssr.launch
```
Then you can run CSSR successfully.

## Use CSSR
### Software Interface
The CSSR interface is divided into three sections. The button section includes buttons for setting simulation parameters and running the simulation. The data section displays the current data of the `/VehicleState` topic. The graph section shows the real-time simulation state.

### Set Parameters (Optional)
`src/CSSR/launch/config.json` defines the initial vehicle state and obstacles. `x` and `y` are the initial UTM coordinates, `speed_x` and `speed_y` are the initial speed, `heading` is the initial heading of the car, and `Obstacles` is the initial obstacles in the figure.
```json
{
    "Init_pos": 
    {   
        "x": 443703.533426, 
        "y": 4429467.347665, 
        "speed_x": 0, 
        "speed_y": 5, 
        "heading": 0.78
    },
    "Obstacles": []
}
``` 
If you want to change the initial vehicle state and obstacles, you can change the value above.

### Generate Obstacles
If you want to generate fixed obstacles, you can click the `Fixed obs` option in the radio button. Then the obstacles will be displayed in the figure.
![Generate Fixed Obstacles](demos/1.jpg)
If you want to generate random obstacles, you can click the `Random obs` option in the radio button, and change the number of obstacles in the spin box. Then the obstacles will be displayed in the figure. If you are not satisfied with the random obstacles, you can click the spin box and press `Enter` to change the random obstacles.
![Generate Random Obstacles](demos/2.jpg)
If you want to load previous simulation parameters and obstacles, you can click the `Load config` option in the radio button, and select the appropriate simulation config file (`config.json`). If the `config.json` is broken or the obstacles in it are invalid, an error message will be displayed in the software, and you will need to reload the config file.

### Run Simulation
Click the `Run` button to run the simulation. Click the `Stop` button to stop the simulation. 
![Run Simulation](demos/4.jpg)
Click the `Clear` button to clear the obstacles and trajectories in the figure.

### View Rostopic
Open a new command window in the `CSSR` folder, and run the code below:
```
source env/bin/activate
source devel/setup.bash
rostopic list
```
Then you can see the `/Control`, `/Obstacle`, and `/VehicleState` topics. If you want to view the details of the `/Control` topic, you can run the code below:
```
rostopic echo /Control
```

### Save Results
Click the `Save` button to save the config file and the figure in the `src/CSSR/logs` folder. The save path will be displayed in the data section.
![Save Results](demos/6.jpg)
The saved figure is shown below:

### Exit
To exit the program, please click the `Ã—` in the top right corner of the window.
